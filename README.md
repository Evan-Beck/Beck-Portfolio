The goal of this project was to create a professional portfolio page for myself using HTML and CSS.

It was important to use CSS elements like flex box's, dividers, and borders. I also had to include images of previous projects which contained a link inside to the live server of those projects.

Since I only have one project, I only made one image contain a live link when you click on it. 

It was also crucial to add clickable links at the top of my webpage, that took the user to the section they clicked on. This navigation bar also contained a link to my live resume. 

Other things that were added were a head-shot image, links to my Github and LinkedIn, and CSS containers.

I have also attached two screenshots into this file of the live website.

Here is the link to the live server of my current webpage -
